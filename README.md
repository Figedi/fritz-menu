# fritz-menu
Menubar application to show current fritzbox bandwidth-usage

## Description

This menubar application lets you see the current bandwidth-usage, directly from your fritzbox-router.

## Download

I try to update the releases as often as possible. See the releases page for prebuilt binaries.

## Development

To install for development, clone this repo and install with npm:

```
# Clone
git clone git@github.com:Figedi/fritz-menu.git && cd fritz-menu

# Install the packages
npm i

# Start dev task
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

Please be advised that this application is currently only tested with the latest Fritz!OS 6.54 on a Fritzbox Router 7330. 
The router-model shouldn't be of your concern, just the router's firmware.
